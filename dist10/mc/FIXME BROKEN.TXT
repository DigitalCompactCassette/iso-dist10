The code as far as I can tell is broken.

The encoder appears to make invalid bitstreams, the decoder doesn't decode the bitstream.

As far as I understand, the output of this encoder is supposed to be backwards
compatible with the main standard (should play in FFMPEG without the multichannel output).
