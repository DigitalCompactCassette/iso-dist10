This is intended to be a cleanup and rework of the reference source code.

If you need a reliable decoder for all your favorite MPEG audio files,
don't use this code, use FFMPEG instead.

However, this can be used to encode formats that FFMPEG does not have
an encoder for, such as MPEG Layer I, or the multichannel extensions.
